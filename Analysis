-- # IMDB Movie Analysis Project

-- ## Step 1: Create the Database
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS imdbmovies;
CREATE DATABASE imdbmovies;

-- Connect to the database
\c imdbmovies;

-- ## Step 2: Create the Movies Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS movies;
CREATE TABLE movies (
    imdbID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    year INT,
    rating TEXT,
    runtime TEXT,
    genre TEXT,
    released DATE,
    director TEXT,
    writer TEXT,
    "cast" TEXT,
    metacritic NUMERIC,
    imdbRating NUMERIC,
    imdbVotes INT,
    poster TEXT,
    plot TEXT,
    fullplot TEXT,
    language TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    awards TEXT,
    lastupdated TEXT,
    type TEXT
);

-- ## Step 3: Import the Data from CSV
\copy movies FROM 'movies_initial.csv' WITH CSV HEADER DELIMITER ',';

-- ## Step 4: Data Cleaning
-- Convert runtime to an integer by removing ' min'
UPDATE movies SET runtime = REGEXP_REPLACE(runtime, ' min', '', 'g')::INT;

-- Handle NULL values by replacing with default values
UPDATE movies SET metacritic = 0 WHERE metacritic IS NULL;
UPDATE movies SET imdbRating = 0 WHERE imdbRating IS NULL;
UPDATE movies SET imdbVotes = 0 WHERE imdbVotes IS NULL;

-- ## Step 5: Data Analysis Queries
-- 1. Find the Top 10 Highest-Rated Movies
SELECT title, year, imdbRating FROM movies 
ORDER BY imdbRating DESC LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Find the Most Common Movie Genres
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) AS genre_count FROM movies 
GROUP BY genre ORDER BY genre_count DESC;

-- 3. Find the Movies with the Most IMDb Votes
SELECT title, imdbVotes FROM movies 
ORDER BY imdbVotes DESC LIMIT 10;

-- 4. Average IMDb Rating per Year
SELECT year, ROUND(AVG(imdbRating), 2) AS avg_rating FROM movies 
GROUP BY year ORDER BY year DESC;

-- 5. Directors with the Most Highly Rated Movies (IMDb Rating > 8.5)
SELECT director, COUNT(*) AS movie_count FROM movies 
WHERE imdbRating > 8.5 GROUP BY director 
ORDER BY movie_count DESC;

-- 6. Average IMDb Rating by Genre
SELECT genre, ROUND(AVG(imdbRating), 2) AS avg_rating FROM movies 
GROUP BY genre ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;

-- 7. Relationship Between IMDb Votes and Ratings
SELECT imdbRating, AVG(imdbVotes) AS avg_votes FROM movies 
GROUP BY imdbRating ORDER BY imdbRating DESC;

-- 8. Find Movies That Won Awards
SELECT title, awards FROM movies 
WHERE awards IS NOT NULL AND awards <> '';

-- 9. Find the Longest Movies in the Dataset
SELECT title, runtime FROM movies 
ORDER BY runtime DESC LIMIT 10;

-- 10. Compare IMDb Rating and Metacritic Score
SELECT title, imdbRating, metacritic FROM movies 
WHERE metacritic > 0 
ORDER BY imdbRating DESC;
